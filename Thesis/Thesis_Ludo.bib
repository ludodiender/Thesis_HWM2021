   abstract = {[Transformations that could be used to reduce the influence of extreme observations of dependent variables, which can assume either sign, on regression coefficient estimates are studied in this article. Two that seem reasonable on a priori grounds--the extended Box-Cox (BC) and the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS)--are evaluated in detail. One feature is that the log-likelihood function for IHS is defined for zero values of the dependent variable, which is not true of BC. The double-length regression technique (Davidson and MacKinnon 1984) is used to perform hypothesis tests of one transformation against the other using Canadian data on household net worth. These tests support the use of IHS instead of BC for this data set. Empirical investigators in economics often work with a logged dependent variable (taking the natural logarithm of a data series is, of course, a special case of BC) to reduce the weight their particular estimation procedure might otherwise attach to extreme values of the dependent variable. Logging dependent and independent variables has the added attraction that slope coefficients may be interpreted as elasticities. In the event that the dependent variable assumes nonpositive values, some researchers (e.g., Diamond and Hausman 1984; King and Dicks-Mireaux 1982) have dropped the nonpositive values and others have added a constant so that each observation is positive. An alternative transformation, which is defined for any real number, is the IHS transformation, <tex-math>$\operatorname{sinh}^{-1}(x) = \log(x + (x^2 + 1)^{1/2})$</tex-math>. This was proposed in Johnson (1949) and is just as easy to employ as the BC transformation.]},

   pages = {e1337},
   abstract = {Accurate observation of the high spatio-temporal variability of rainfall is crucial for hydrometeorological applications. However, the existing observations from rain gauges and weather radars have individual shortcomings that can introduce considerable errors and uncertainties. A fairly new technique to get additional rainfall information is the usage of the country-wide commercial microwave link (CML) networks for rainfall estimation by exploiting the measurements of rain-induced attenuation along these CMLs. This technique has seen an increasing number of applications during the last years. Different methods have been developed to process the noisy raw data and to derive rainfall fields. It has been shown that CMLs can provide important line-integrated rainfall information that complements pointwise rain gauge and spatial radar observations. There exist several limitations, though. Robustly dealing with the erratic fluctuations of the CML raw data is a challenge, in particular with the growing number of CMLs. How to correctly compensate for the biases from the effect of wet antenna attenuation for different CMLs also remains a crucial research question. Progress is additionally hampered by the lack of method intercomparisons, which in turn is hampered by restricted data sharing. Hence, collaboration is key for further advancements, also with regard to extended interaction with the CML network operators, which is a prerequisite to achieve increased data availability. In regions where rain gauges and weather radars are available, CMLs are a welcome complement. But in developing countries, which are characterized by weak technical infrastructure and which often suffer from water stress, additional rainfall information is a necessity. CMLs could play a crucial role in this respect. This article is categorized under: Science of Water > Hydrological Processes Science of Water > Water Extremes Science of Water > Methods},

In collaboration with one national cellular phone operator, Telecel Faso, the attenuation on a 29 km long microwave link operating at 7 GHz was monitored at 1 s time rate for the monsoon season 2012. The time series of attenuation is transformed into rain rates and compared with rain gauge data. The method is successful in quantifying rainfall: 95% of the rainy days are detected. The correlation with the daily rain gauge series is 0.8, and the season bias is 6%. The correlation at the 5 min time step within each event is also high. These results demonstrate the potential interest of exploiting national and regional wireless telecommunication networks for monitoring rainfall in Africa, where operational rain gauge networks are degrading and the hydrometeorological risk increasing.},

Training is conducted using back propagation where the input and output rainfall fields are presented to the neural network as a series of learning sets. After training is complete, the neural network is used to forecast rainfall intensity fields with a lead time of 1 h using only the current field as input. Rainfall fields are generated using a space-time mathematical rainfall simulation model, and forecasted fields are compared with the perfectly known model-produced fields. Results indicate that a neural network is capable of learning the complex relationship describing the space-time evolution of rainfall such as that inherent in a complex rainfall simulation model. One hour ahead forecasts are produced, and comparisons with true mean areal intensities and percent areal coverage indicate that in most cases the method performs well when applied to the events used in training. The neural network is used to forecast a series of events not included in the training data and is shown to perform well when a relatively large number of hidden nodes are utilized. Performance of the neural network is compared with two other methods of short-term forecasting, persistence and nowcasting.},

   abstract = {As a type of clean and renewable energy source, wind power is widely used. However, owing to the uncertainty of wind speed, it is essential to build an accurate forecasting model for large-scale wind power penetration. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) and data-driven modeling are two typical paradigms. NWP is usually unavailable or spatially insufficient. Data-driven modeling is an effective candidate. As to some newly-built wind farms, sufficient historical data is not available for training an accurate model, while some older wind farms may have long-term wind speed records. A question arises regarding whether the prediction model trained by data coming from older farms is also effective for a newly-built farm. In this paper, we propose an interesting trial of transferring the information obtained from data-rich farms to a newly-built farm. It is well known that deep learning can extract a high-level representation of raw data. We introduce deep neural networks, trained by data from data-rich farms, to extract wind speed patterns, and then finely tune the mapping with data coming from newly-built farms. In this way, the trained network transfers information from one farm to another. The experimental results show that prediction errors are significantly reduced using the proposed technique.},

Rainfall nowcasting, the process of statistically extrapolating recent rainfall observations, is increasingly used for short-term forecasting. Nowcasts are generally constructed with high-resolution radar observations. As a proof of concept, we construct nowcasts with country-wide rainfall maps estimated from signal level data of commercial microwave links (CMLs) for 12 summer days in the Netherlands. CML nowcasts compare well to radar rainfall nowcasts. Provided well-calibrated CML rainfall estimates are employed, CML nowcasts can outperform unadjusted real-time radar nowcasts for high rainfall rates, which are underestimated as compared to a reference. Care should be taken with the sensitivity of the advection field derivation to areas with low CML coverage and the inherent measurement scale of CML data, which can be larger than the application scale. We see potential for rainfall nowcasting with CML data, for example, in regions where weather radars are absent.},

Theoretical analyses show that the specific attenuation of an electromagnetic signal at this frequency varies nearly linearly with the rainfall intensity, which is ideal for line-integrating instruments. The dependence of this relation on the drop size distribution and on the temperature is small, so that uncertainties in these variables do not play large roles in the estimation of rainfall intensity. Data from an experiment with a 4.89-km microwave link and a line configuration of seven tipping bucket rain gauges are used to test whether this instrument is indeed suitable for the estimation of path-averaged rainfall. Results from this experiment show that the attenuation due to wet antennas can have a significant effect on the retrieved rainfall intensity. However, when a two-parameter wet antenna correction function is applied to the link data, comparisons with the rain gauge data show that the instrument is indeed well suited for the measurement of path-averaged rainfall.},

Microwave link signals are generated for different link frequencies and lengths from these radar data, so that retrieved path-averaged rainfall intensities can be compared to true path-averaged values. Results of these simulations can be linked to the space–time structure of rain. A frequency-dependent relation between the rainfall intensity at an antenna and the attenuation caused by its wetting is derived using microwave link and rain gauge data. It is shown that if the correct temporal sampling strategy is chosen, the effects of the degradation of power resolution and of wet antenna attenuation (if a correction is applied) are minor (i.e., MBE and bias-corrected RMSE are >−20% and <20% of the mean rainfall intensity, respectively) for link frequencies and lengths above ∼20GHz and ∼2km, respectively.},

   abstract = {Unsupervised learning of time series data, also known as temporal clustering, is a challenging problem in machine learning. Here we propose a novel algorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), to naturally integrate dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into a single end-to-end learning framework, fully unsupervised. The algorithm utilizes an autoencoder for temporal dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. Then it jointly optimizes the clustering objective and the dimensionality reduction objec tive. Based on requirement and application, the temporal clustering layer can be customized with any temporal similarity metric. Several similarity metrics and state-of-the-art algorithms are considered and compared. To gain insight into temporal features that the network has learned for its clustering, we apply a visualization method that generates a region of interest heatmap for the time series. The viability of the algorithm is demonstrated using time series data from diverse domains, ranging from earthquakes to spacecraft sensor data. In each case, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional methods. The superior performance is attributed to the fully integrated temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criterion.},

   journal = {Water Resources Research},
   volume = {47},
   number = {12},
   abstract = {The estimation of rainfall using commercial microwave links is a new and promising measurement technique. Commercial link networks cover large parts of the land surface of the earth and have a high density, particularly in urban areas. Rainfall attenuates the electromagnetic signals transmitted between antennas within this network. This attenuation can be calculated from the difference between the received powers with and without rain and is a measure of the path-averaged rainfall intensity. This study uses a 17-day data set of, on average, 57 single-frequency links from 2009 to estimate rainfall in the Rotterdam region, a densely populated delta city in Netherlands (≈1250 km2, >1 million inhabitants). A methodology is proposed where nearby links are used to remove signal fluctuations that are not related to rainfall in order to be able to reliably identify wet and dry weather spells. Subsequently, received signal powers are converted to path-averaged rainfall intensities, taking into account the temporal sampling protocol and attenuation due to wet antennas. Link-based rainfall depths are compared with those based on gauge-adjusted radar data. In addition, the rainfall retrieval algorithm is applied to an independent data set of 21 rainy days in 2010 with on average 16 single-frequency links in the same region. Rainfall retrievals are compared against gauge-adjusted radar rainfall estimates over the link path. Moreover, the retrieval algorithm is also tested using high-resolution research link data to investigate the algorithm's sensitivity to temporal rainfall variations. All presented comparisons confirm the quality of commercial microwave link data for quantitative precipitation estimation over urban areas.},

   abstract = {Accurate and timely surface precipitation measurements are crucial for water resources management, agriculture, weather prediction, climate research, as well as ground validation of satellite-based precipitation estimates. However, the majority of the land surface of the earth lacks such data, and in many parts of the world the density of surface precipitation gauging networks is even rapidly declining. This development can potentially be counteracted by using received signal level data from the enormous number of microwave links used worldwide in commercial cellular communication networks. Along such links, radio signals propagate from a transmitting antenna at one base station to a receiving antenna at another base station. Rain-induced attenuation and, subsequently, path-averaged rainfall intensity can be retrieved from the signal’s attenuation between transmitter and receiver. Here, we show how one such a network can be used to retrieve the space–time dynamics of rainfall for an entire country (The Netherlands, ∼35,500 km2), based on an unprecedented number of links (∼2,400) and a rainfall retrieval algorithm that can be applied in real time. This demonstrates the potential of such networks for real-time rainfall monitoring, in particular in those parts of the world where networks of dedicated ground-based rainfall sensors are often virtually absent.},

   abstract = {Abstract Commercial microwave links (CMLs) have proven useful for providing rainfall information close to the ground surface. However, large uncertainties are associated with these retrievals, partly due to challenges in the type of data collection and processing. In particular, the most common case is when only minimum and maximum received signal levels (RSLs) over a given time interval (hereafter 15 min) are stored by mobile network operators. The average attenuation and the corresponding rainfall rate are then calculated based on a weighted average method using the minimum and maximum attenuation. In this study, an alternative to using a constant weighted average method is explored, based on a machine learning model trained to produce actual attenuation from minimum/maximum values. A rainfall retrieval deep learning model was designed based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) model architecture and trained with disdrometer data in a form that is comparable to the data provided by mobile network operators. A first evaluation used only disdrometer data to mimic both attenuation from a CML and corresponding rainfall rates. For the test data set, the relative bias was reduced from 5.99% to 2.84% and the coefficient of determination (R2) increased from 0.86 to 0.97. The second evaluation used this disdrometer-trained LSTM to retrieve rainfall rates from an actual CML located nearby the disdrometer. A significant improvement in the overall rainfall estimation compared to existing microwave link attenuation models was observed. The relative bias reduced from 7.39% to −1.14% and the R2 improved from 0.71 to 0.82.},

Employing the concept of ensemble learning facilitates robust and collective decision on test data, whereas deep base and meta-regressors ultimately enhance the performance of the proposed DNN-MRT approach. The concept of transfer learning not only saves time required during training of a base-regressor on each individual wind farm dataset from scratch but also stipulates good weight initialization points for each of the wind farm for training. The effectiveness of the proposed, DNN-MRT technique is expressed by comparing statistical performance measures in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation error (SDE) with other existing techniques.},

   volume = {104-105},
   pages = {119-127},
   abstract = {Rainfall measurements have been investigated worldwide because of their important implications in meteorology, hydrology, flood warnings and fresh water resource management. Recently a new way of measuring rainfall based on commercial microwave radio links that form cellular communication networks has been proposed, in which the path-integrated rainfall intensity is estimated from the received signal level. This method can reveal fine-scale evolution of rainfall in space and time and allows observation of near-surface rainfall at a spatial resolution of up to 1×1km2 and a temporal resolution of up to 1min, with no additional installation and maintenance costs. Here we examine two different methodologies for calculating instantaneous rainfall from microwave links. The study region covers a 1600km2 area in central Israel which includes up to 70 commercial microwave links, and 7 rain gauges installed in the vicinity of the links. 19 rainstorm events over a two year period covering about a 676h overall period, are evaluated. The first methodology uses data from the nearest microwave link while the second uses data interpolated at the point of the rain gauge from multiple nearby links. Results are compared to results from nearby rain gauges. At temporal resolutions of 1min correlations of 0.65 and .77, with biases of −0.08 and −0.06mmh−1 were attained for the first and second methods, respectively. At the temporal resolution of 10min, the correlations of 0.84 and 0.85, with biases of −0.11 and −0.06mmh−1 were attained. On average, application of the interpolation point methodology underestimated accumulated rainfall by only 3% as compared to nearby rain gauges. The single link method overestimated rainfall by 6%. Both methodologies improved (worsened) as the density of the microwave link grid increased (decreased).},

   abstract = {Accurate and timely precipitation estimates are critical for monitoring and forecasting natural disasters such as floods. Despite having high-resolution satellite information, precipitation estimation from remotely sensed data still suffers from methodological limitations. State-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, renowned for their skill in learning accurate patterns within large and complex datasets, appear well suited to the task of precipitation estimation, given the ample amount of high-resolution satellite data. In this study, the effectiveness of applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) together with the infrared (IR) and water vapor (WV) channels from geostationary satellites for estimating precipitation rate is explored. The proposed model performances are evaluated during summer 2012 and 2013 over central CONUS at the spatial resolution of 0.08 degrees and at an hourly time scale. Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN)-Cloud Classification System (CCS), which is an operational satellite-based product, and PERSIANN-Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (PERSIANN-SDAE) are employed as baseline models. Results demonstrate that the proposed model (PERSIANN-CNN) provides more accurate rainfall estimates compared to the baseline models at various temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, PERSIANN-CNN outperforms PERSIANN-CCS (and PERSIANN-SDAE) by 54% (and 23%) in the critical success index (CSI), demonstrating the detection skills of the model. Furthermore, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the rainfall estimates with respect to the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Stage IV gauge-radar data, for PERSIANN-CNN was lower than that of PERSIANN-CCS (PERSIANN-SDAE) by 37% (14%), showing the estimation accuracy of the proposed model.},

Transfer learning relaxes the hypothesis that the training data must be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with the test data, which motivates us to use transfer learning to solve the problem of insufficient training data. This survey focuses on reviewing the current researches of transfer learning by using deep neural network and its applications.

   abstract = {Microwave backhaul links from cellular communication networks provide a valuable “opportunistic” source of high-resolution space–time rainfall information, complementing traditional in situ measurement devices (rain gauges, disdrometers) and remote sensors (weather radars, satellites). Over the past decade, a growing community of researchers has, in close collaboration with cellular communication companies, developed retrieval algorithms to convert the raw microwave link signals, stored operationally by their network management systems, to hydrometeorologically useful rainfall estimates. Operational meteorological and hydrological services as well as private consulting firms are showing an increased interest in using this complementary source of rainfall information to improve the products and services they provide to end users from different sectors, from water management and weather prediction to agriculture and traffic control. The greatest potential of these opportunistic environmental sensors lies in those geographical areas over the land surface of the Earth where the densities of traditional rainfall measurement devices are low: mountainous and urban areas and the developing world.

Therefore, there is a need to create high-performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains. This methodology is referred to as transfer learning. This survey paper formally defines transfer learning, presents information on current solutions, and reviews applications applied to transfer learning.
